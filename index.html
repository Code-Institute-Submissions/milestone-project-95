						<h3>What is dementia?<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						<p>The word ‘dementia’ describes a set of symptoms that may include memory loss and difficulties
							with thinking, problem-solving or language.<br><br>

							These changes are often small to start with, but for someone with dementia they have become
							severe enough to affect daily life.<br><br>

							Dementia is caused when the brain is damaged by diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease or a
							series of strokes. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, but not the
							only one.</p>

						<h3>Dementia symptoms<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						Dementia tends to affect people differently but some common signs of early dementia are: <br><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Day-to-day memory – for example, difficulty recalling events that happened recently</li>
							<li>Language – for example, difficulties following a conversation or finding the right word
								for something</li>
							<li>Visuospatial skills – for example, problems judging distances (such as on stairs) and
								seeing objects in three dimensions</li>
							<li>Orientation – for example, losing track of the day or date, or becoming confused about
								where they are</li>

						<h3>Dementia Causes<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						<ul>
							<li><span>Alzheimer’s disease</span> – This is the most common cause of dementia. In
								Alzheimer’s disease, an abnormal protein surrounds brain cells and another protein
								damages their internal structure. In time, chemical connections between brain cells are
								lost and cells begin to die.</li>
							<li><span>Vascular dementia</span> – If the oxygen supply to the brain is reduced because of
								narrowing or blockage of blood vessels, some brain cells become damaged or die. This is
								what happens in vascular dementia.</li>
							<li><span>Dementia with Lewy bodies</span> – This type of dementia involves tiny abnormal
								structures (Lewy bodies) forming inside brain cells. They disrupt the chemistry of the
								brain and lead to the death of brain cells</li>
							<li><span>Frontotemporal dementia (including Pick’s disease)</span> – In frontotemporal
								dementia, the front and side parts of the brain are damaged. Clumps of abnormal proteins
								form inside brain cells, causing them to die. </li>

						<h3>Who gets dementia?<i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						<p>Dementia mainly affects people over the age of 65 (one in 14 people in this age group have
							dementia), and the likelihood of developing dementia increases significantly with
							age.<br><br>

							However, dementia can affect younger people too. There are more than 42,000 people in the UK
							under 65 with dementia.<br><br>

                            Scientists are investigating how dementia might run in the family. In a very small number of people, certain types of dementia are inherited as a single gene that directly causes the disease.
                            People with one of these genes will usually get dementia before the age of 65.

						<h3>Dementia diagnosis <i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						<p>There is no single test for dementia. A diagnosis is based on a combination of things:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>taking a ‘history’ – the doctor talking to the person and someone who knows them well about how their problems developed and how they are now affecting their daily life</li>
                            <li>physical examination and tests (for example, blood tests) to exclude other possible causes of the person’s symptoms</li>
                            <li>tests of mental abilities (for example, memory, thinking) – simpler tests will be carried out by a nurse or doctor, more specialist tests by a psychologist</li>
                            <li>a scan of the brain, if this is needed to make the diagnosis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A common pattern is for the GP to make an initial assessment and then refer the person to a memory clinic or other specialist service for a more detailed assessment. 
                        A specialist doctor will have more expertise in dementia and will be able to arrange more detailed tests and brain scans, if needed</p>

						<h3>Dementia treatments <i class="fas fa-angle-double-down"></i></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="para-container hidden">
						<h5>Non-drug Treatments</h5>
                        <p>A range of support is available after a diagnosis has been made:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talking therapies, such as counselling, can help someone come to terms with their diagnosis or discuss their feelings.</li>
                            <li>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be offered if the person develops depression or anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Cognitive stimulation therapy is a popular way to help keep someone’s mind active. It involves doing themed activity sessions over several weeks.</li>
                            <li>Other popular activities include music, singing or art. It is vital that people with dementia stay as active as they can – physically, mentally and socially. 
                            Taking part in meaningful activities is enjoyable and leads to increased confidence and self-esteem.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Drug Treatments</h5>
                        <p>A person with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease or mixed dementia in which Alzheimer’s is the main cause may be prescribed one of 
                        three different drugs: donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine. These may give temporary help with memory, motivation, concentration and daily living. 
                        In the moderate or severe stages of Alzheimer’s disease someone may be offered a different drug called memantine. This may help with attention and daily living,
                         and possibly ease distressing or challenging behaviours.</p>
